### 33.5 Load Testing

1. Write a load test using `vegeta` library: send 100 RPS to an endpoint for 30 seconds and print latency percentiles.
1. Write a custom load test in pure Go: spawn N goroutines, each sending requests in a loop, and collect latency histograms using `sync.Mutex`.

1. Implement a two-level cache (in-memory L1 + Redis L2) with `singleflight` on both levels. Benchmark cache hit rates under concurrent access.
1. Implement cache stampede prevention using probabilistic early expiration: refresh the cache before TTL expires with a probability that increases as expiration approaches.

### 39.2 Advanced Channel Patterns

1. Implement a fan-out/fan-in pattern where a slow consumer is protected by a dropping channel: if the buffer is full, new messages are discarded.
1. Write an `OrDone` channel combinator: given a `done` channel and a data channel, return a channel that closes when either closes.

1. Add error handling to the pipeline: write failed rows to a dead-letter file with the error message, continue processing the rest.

### 47.2 Backpressure

1. Implement a pipeline with backpressure using buffered channels: a slow consumer causes the producer to block when the buffer is full.
1. Write a dropping pipeline: if the consumer is too slow, drop the oldest messages (ring buffer semantics) and log the drop count.

## Block 48: Advanced HTTP and Networking

### 48.1 HTTP/2

1. Write an HTTP/2 server using `net/http` with TLS (HTTP/2 is enabled automatically with TLS). Verify with `curl --http2`.
1. Implement server push: use `http.Pusher` to push a CSS file alongside an HTML response.

1. Implement connection warm-up: pre-establish connections to downstream services on startup before accepting traffic.

### 48.4 Server-Sent Events and Long Polling

1. Implement an SSE endpoint with reconnection support: send a `Last-Event-ID` header from the client and resume from the correct position.
1. Implement long polling: client sends a request, server holds it open until new data is available or a timeout expires, then responds.
1. Write a broadcast hub for SSE: multiple clients subscribe, the server sends events to all connected clients concurrently using a fan-out pattern.

## Block 49: Go Module Governance

### 49.1 Vendoring

1. Vendor all dependencies with `go mod vendor`. Build with `go build -mod=vendor` and verify the binary works without network access.

### 49.2 Private Modules and Proxies

1. Configure `GOPRIVATE` to bypass the public proxy for private modules: `GOPRIVATE=github.com/myorg/*`.
1. Set up `GOPROXY` with a fallback chain: `GOPROXY=https://proxy.myorg.com,https://proxy.golang.org,direct`.

### 54.4 Technical Debt Management

1. Write a Go program that scans a codebase for `TODO`, `FIXME`, and `HACK` comments and generates a technical debt report with file, line, author (from `git blame`), and age.

1. Define a Protobuf message `OrderCreated` with 5 fields. Add a new optional field in a backward-compatible way. Write a test that deserializes old messages with the new schema.
1. Remove a field from a Protobuf message by reserving its field number with `reserved`. Write a test proving that old serialized data still deserializes without error.
1. Implement a schema registry client: register a Protobuf schema by subject, retrieve it by ID, and check compatibility before producing messages.
1. Write a consumer that handles multiple versions of an event: detect the schema version from a header and deserialize accordingly.

### 55.2 Change Data Capture (CDC)

1. Write a program that reads PostgreSQL WAL changes using logical replication (`pglogrepl` or `pgx` logical replication support) and prints INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE events.
1. Implement a CDC pipeline: capture row changes from PostgreSQL, transform them into domain events, and publish to a Kafka topic.
1. Write a CDC consumer that maintains a read-optimized materialized view in Redis by applying database change events in order.
1. Handle CDC ordering guarantees: partition events by primary key so that updates to the same row are always processed in order.

1. Implement a Kafka consumer that retries failed messages 3 times with backoff, then publishes them to a dead letter topic with the original message, error, and retry count in headers.
1. Write a dead letter queue processor that reads messages from the DLQ, displays them in a CLI tool, and allows manual replay to the original topic.
1. Implement poison pill detection: if the same message fails N times across consumer restarts, move it to the DLQ and continue processing the partition.

### 55.4 Ordering and Partitioning

1. Write a Kafka producer that uses a consistent partition key (e.g., `userID`) to guarantee ordering of events for the same entity.
1. Implement an event resequencer: consume out-of-order events (each carrying a sequence number), buffer them, and emit in order once gaps are filled.
1. Write a test that verifies ordering guarantees: produce 100 events for the same key and assert the consumer receives them in the exact same order.

## Block 56: Advanced Caching

### 56.1 Cache Invalidation Strategies

1. Implement write-through caching: on every database write, update the cache synchronously before returning to the caller.
1. Implement write-behind (write-back) caching: buffer writes in the cache and flush them to the database asynchronously in batches using a background goroutine.
1. Implement event-based cache invalidation: listen to a Kafka topic of data change events and delete or update the corresponding cache entries.
1. Write a test that verifies cache consistency: perform a write, then immediately read from a different instance, and assert the cache is up to date.

### 56.2 Distributed Cache Patterns

1. Implement a two-level cache: L1 is an in-memory LRU cache (`map` + doubly linked list), L2 is Redis. Check L1 first, then L2, then the database.
1. Write a cache-aside pattern with `singleflight`: on cache miss, only one goroutine fetches from the database, populates both L1 and L2, and returns the result to all waiters.
1. Implement cache warming on startup: preload the top N most frequently accessed keys from the database into the cache before the service marks itself as ready.
1. Implement probabilistic early expiration: refresh a cache entry before its TTL expires with a probability that increases as the expiration approaches. Benchmark thundering herd reduction.

### 56.3 LRU Cache Implementation

1. Implement an LRU cache with `Get(key) (value, bool)` and `Put(key, value)` using a `map` and a doubly linked list. Ensure O(1) for both operations.
1. Make the LRU cache thread-safe using `sync.RWMutex`. Benchmark read-heavy workloads with `RWMutex` vs `sync.Mutex`.
1. Add TTL support to the LRU cache: entries expire after a configurable duration. Use a lazy expiration strategy (check on access) and a background goroutine for periodic cleanup.
1. Implement cache size limiting by memory (not just entry count): track approximate memory usage using `unsafe.Sizeof` and evict entries when the limit is reached.

## Block 57: Async Job Processing

### 57.1 Background Jobs with Asynq

1. Set up `asynq` with Redis: define a task type `email:send` with a JSON payload, enqueue it from an HTTP handler, and process it in a worker.
1. Configure task retries with exponential backoff: set `MaxRetry: 5` and a custom `RetryDelayFunc`. Write a test that verifies retry behavior.
1. Implement task priority queues: define `critical`, `default`, and `low` queues with different processing weights.
1. Add a unique task constraint: ensure that only one `report:generate` task per `userID` is enqueued at a time using `asynq.Unique`.

### 57.2 Scheduled and Delayed Jobs

1. Implement a delayed job: enqueue a `reminder:send` task that executes 24 hours after creation using `asynq.ProcessIn(24 * time.Hour)`.
1. Implement a cron-like scheduler: register a periodic task that runs every 5 minutes using `asynq.NewScheduler` with a cron expression.
1. Write a distributed cron job: ensure that only one instance of a periodic task runs across multiple worker nodes using Redis-based locking.

### 57.3 Job Processing Patterns

1. Implement a job chain: `CreateOrder -> SendConfirmationEmail -> UpdateAnalytics`. Each job enqueues the next one on success.
1. Implement a fan-out job: a single `batch:process` job spawns N child jobs (one per item) and tracks their completion in Redis.
1. Write a dead letter handler for failed jobs: after all retries are exhausted, write the task payload and error to a PostgreSQL `failed_jobs` table for manual inspection.
1. Implement graceful shutdown for a worker: on `SIGTERM`, stop accepting new jobs, wait for in-progress jobs to finish (up to 30 seconds), then exit.

## Block 58: Advanced Database Patterns

### 58.1 Locking Strategies

1. Implement optimistic locking: add a `version` column to a table, read the version with the row, and use `UPDATE ... WHERE version = $1` to detect conflicts. Return a `ErrConflict` on mismatch.
1. Implement pessimistic locking: use `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` to lock a row during a transaction. Write a test with two concurrent goroutines to verify mutual exclusion.
1. Implement a distributed lock using PostgreSQL advisory locks: `pg_advisory_lock(key)` and `pg_advisory_unlock(key)`. Write a wrapper `func WithAdvisoryLock(ctx context.Context, db *sql.DB, key int64, fn func() error) error`.
1. Compare optimistic vs pessimistic locking under high contention: write a benchmark where 50 goroutines update the same row and measure throughput and conflict rate for each strategy.

### 58.2 Partitioning and Materialized Views

1. Write SQL migrations to create a range-partitioned `events` table by month in PostgreSQL. Write a Go function that inserts events and queries across partitions transparently.
1. Implement automatic partition management: write a Go function that creates future partitions (next 3 months) and drops old partitions (older than 12 months).
1. Create a materialized view for an analytics dashboard: `CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW daily_stats AS ...`. Write a Go function that refreshes it concurrently with `REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY`.
1. Implement an incremental materialized view in Go: maintain an in-memory aggregate that updates on each INSERT event instead of recomputing from scratch.

### 58.3 Audit Logging

1. Write a PostgreSQL trigger (via migration) that logs every INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE on a `users` table to an `audit_log` table with `operation`, `old_data`, `new_data`, `changed_by`, and `changed_at`.
1. Implement application-level audit logging: write a repository wrapper that records every mutation to an `audit_events` table in the same transaction as the business operation.
1. Write a query function that reconstructs the state of a row at a given point in time by replaying audit events from the creation event up to the target timestamp.

1. Write a `slog.Handler` that adds log level colorization for terminal output while keeping JSON format for production.

### 59.2 maps and slices Packages (Go 1.21+)

1. Use `slices.SortFunc` to sort a `[]Person` by age, then by name for equal ages. Compare verbosity with the old `sort.Slice` approach.
1. Use `slices.Contains`, `slices.Index`, and `slices.Compact` to process a slice of strings: check membership, find position, and remove consecutive duplicates.
1. Use `maps.Keys`, `maps.Values`, and `maps.Equal` to work with maps. Write a function that returns the symmetric difference of two maps using these helpers.
1. Use `slices.BinarySearch` on a sorted slice and compare it with `sort.Search`.

1. Refactor an `embed.FS` usage to accept any `fs.FS`, making it testable with `fstest.MapFS` and swappable with `os.DirFS` at runtime.
1. Write a `WalkTemplates(fsys fs.FS) ([]string, error)` function that finds all `.tmpl` files. Test it with `fstest.MapFS` containing a nested directory structure.
1. Implement an `fs.FS` backed by an S3-compatible client: `Open` fetches the object, `ReadDir` lists the prefix. Use `fstest.TestFS` to validate the implementation.

### 59.5 net/netip Package (Go 1.18+)

1. Parse an IPv4 and IPv6 address with `netip.ParseAddr`. Print whether each is IPv4, IPv6, loopback, or link-local.
1. Parse a CIDR prefix with `netip.ParsePrefix` and write a function `Contains(prefix netip.Prefix, addr netip.Addr) bool` that checks if an address belongs to the prefix.
1. Implement an IP allowlist using `[]netip.Prefix` and write middleware that rejects requests from addresses not in any allowed prefix.
1. Benchmark `netip.Addr` comparisons vs `net.IP` comparisons in a hot path to demonstrate the performance advantage of the value-type design.

### 59.6 cmp Package (Go 1.21+)

1. Write a middleware that sets `MaxBytesReader` on the request body to limit payload size. Return `413 Payload Too Large` for oversized requests.
1. Configure `MaxHeaderBytes` on the server and write a test that sends a request with an oversized header and verifies it's rejected.

### 60.2 Connection Management

1. Write a load test that opens 1000 concurrent connections. Tune `http.Server` with `ConnState` callback to log connection state transitions (new, active, idle, closed).
1. Implement connection draining: on `SIGTERM`, stop accepting new connections, set a deadline for existing ones, and log connections that are forcefully closed.

## Block 61: Graceful Degradation and Resilience

### 61.1 Fallback Strategies

1. Implement a service that calls an external API with a fallback: if the API returns an error or times out, return a cached response from Redis with a `X-Fallback: true` header.
1. Write a handler that returns a partial response: if one of three downstream calls fails, return the successful results with a `warnings` field indicating the degraded data.
1. Implement a circuit breaker with a static fallback: when the circuit is open, return a default response instead of an error.
1. Write a health-aware load balancer: track success rates per backend and stop sending traffic to unhealthy backends. Periodically probe them and restore traffic when they recover.

### 61.2 Request Hedging

1. Implement request hedging: send a request to two backends simultaneously, return the first successful response, and cancel the other using `context.WithCancel`.
1. Implement delayed hedging: send a request to backend A, if no response in 100ms send the same request to backend B, return whichever responds first.
1. Write a benchmark comparing hedged requests vs single requests under simulated variable latency. Measure p50, p95, p99 improvements.

## Block 62: API Gateway and BFF

### 62.1 API Composition

1. Write an API gateway handler that aggregates data from three microservices (`UserService`, `OrderService`, `ProductService`) into a single response using `errgroup` for concurrent fetching.
1. Implement request fan-out with partial failure handling: if one service is down, return the available data with a `degraded: true` flag and a list of failed services.
1. Write a response transformer: the gateway accepts a `fields` query parameter and strips unwanted fields from the aggregated response before returning it to the client.

### 62.2 Backend for Frontend (BFF)

1. Build a BFF for a mobile client: aggregate user profile, recent orders, and notifications into a single `GET /mobile/home` endpoint optimized for the mobile screen.
1. Build a BFF for a web dashboard: aggregate analytics summary, recent activity, and alerts into a single `GET /web/dashboard` endpoint with different field selection than the mobile BFF.
1. Write a BFF middleware that transforms snake_case API responses to camelCase for JavaScript clients.

### 62.3 Gateway Middleware

1. Implement a gateway-level rate limiter that enforces per-API-key limits across all downstream services using Redis-backed token buckets.
1. Write a request routing middleware that reads an `X-Api-Version` header and proxies the request to the corresponding backend version.
1. Implement request/response logging at the gateway level: log sanitized request bodies (redact sensitive fields) and response status codes with latency.

## Block 63: Distributed Transactions

### 63.1 Two-Phase Commit (2PC)

1. Implement a simplified 2PC coordinator: send `Prepare` to two participants (simulated as goroutines), collect votes, then send `Commit` or `Abort` based on unanimity.
1. Handle participant failure: if a participant times out during the prepare phase, the coordinator sends `Abort` to all participants.
1. Implement a participant that writes a prepare log before voting `Yes` and uses it to recover after a crash (simulate crash with `panic` + `recover`).

### 63.2 TCC Pattern (Try-Confirm-Cancel)

1. Implement a TCC flow for a transfer: `Try` reserves funds in both accounts, `Confirm` commits the transfer, `Cancel` releases the reservations.
1. Write a TCC coordinator that calls `Try` on all participants, then `Confirm` if all succeed or `Cancel` if any fail. Handle partial `Cancel` failures with retries.
1. Add timeout-based auto-cancellation: if `Confirm` is not called within 5 minutes after `Try`, a background goroutine automatically calls `Cancel`.

### 63.3 Outbox Pattern in Depth

1. Implement the transactional outbox pattern: write a domain event to an `outbox` table in the same database transaction as the business data.
1. Write an outbox poller that reads unpublished events every second using `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`, publishes them to Kafka, and marks them as published.
1. Implement outbox cleanup: write a background job that deletes published outbox records older than 7 days.
1. Write a test that verifies atomicity: if the business operation fails, no outbox record is created; if it succeeds, the outbox record is always present.

## Block 64: Advanced Observability

### 64.1 Continuous Profiling

1. Integrate `pyroscope-go` into an HTTP server for continuous CPU and memory profiling. Tag profiles with service name and version labels.
1. Write a middleware that attaches request path and tenant ID as profiling labels so that profiles can be filtered by endpoint or tenant.
1. Implement on-demand profiling: expose an endpoint `POST /debug/profile` that captures a 30-second CPU profile and returns it as a downloadable file.

### 64.2 OpenTelemetry Collector

1. Configure an OpenTelemetry Collector pipeline: receive OTLP traces from a Go service, batch them, and export to Jaeger.
1. Add a metrics pipeline to the collector: receive OTLP metrics from a Go service and export to Prometheus.
1. Implement tail-based sampling in the collector: only export traces that contain an error span or exceed 1 second duration.

### 64.3 Exemplars and Metrics-to-Traces Correlation

1. Attach trace ID as an exemplar to a Prometheus histogram observation using `prometheus.ExemplarObserver`. Verify the exemplar appears in Prometheus.
1. Write a middleware that records HTTP request duration as a histogram with an exemplar containing the trace ID, enabling one-click navigation from a Grafana metric to the corresponding trace.

### 64.4 SLO Implementation

1. Define SLOs for an API service (99.9% availability, p99 < 500ms). Write Prometheus recording rules that compute error budget consumption over a 30-day rolling window.
1. Implement an error budget tracker in Go: query Prometheus, calculate remaining error budget as a percentage, and expose it as a Prometheus gauge.
1. Write a multi-dependency health aggregator: check database, cache, and message broker. Return structured JSON with per-dependency status (`ok`, `degraded`, `down`) and overall health.

## Block 65: Data Formats and Serialization

### 65.1 Protocol Buffers Advanced

1. Use Protobuf `oneof` to model a `PaymentMethod` that is either `CreditCard`, `BankTransfer`, or `Wallet`. Marshal and unmarshal in Go.
1. Use Protobuf `map` field type to model a `Metadata map<string, string>` in a message. Write tests for serialization and deserialization.
1. Use well-known types: `google.protobuf.Timestamp`, `google.protobuf.Duration`, `google.protobuf.Struct`. Convert between Go `time.Time` and Protobuf `Timestamp`.
1. Implement a Protobuf-to-JSON gateway: accept a Protobuf-encoded request body, unmarshal it, process it, and return a JSON response using `protojson.Marshal`.

### 65.2 Binary Formats

1. Serialize and deserialize a struct using MessagePack (`vmihailenco/msgpack`). Benchmark against `encoding/json` for a nested struct with 20 fields.
1. Serialize and deserialize a struct using CBOR (`fxamacker/cbor`). Compare payload sizes with JSON and MessagePack for the same data.
1. Write a benchmark comparing serialization formats (JSON, Protobuf, MessagePack, CBOR) for throughput (ops/sec), payload size, and allocation count.

### 65.3 Configuration Formats

1. Parse a YAML configuration file into a Go struct using `gopkg.in/yaml.v3`. Handle nested structs, slices, and maps.
1. Parse a TOML configuration file into a Go struct using `pelletier/go-toml`. Compare with YAML for readability and type safety.
1. Write a unified configuration loader that reads the same config from JSON, YAML, or TOML based on file extension, returning the same Go struct.

### 65.4 CSV Processing

1. Read a CSV file using `encoding/csv`, parse each row into a struct, and print invalid rows with line numbers and errors.
1. Write a CSV export function: given a `[]User`, write a CSV file with headers derived from struct field names using `reflect`.
1. Implement streaming CSV processing: read a 1GB CSV file line-by-line without loading it entirely into memory, transform each row, and write to an output CSV.

## Block 66: Incident Management and On-Call

### 66.1 Runbooks

1. Write a runbook template with sections: Alert Name, Severity, Symptoms, Investigation Steps, Mitigation Steps, Root Cause Checklist, Escalation Path.
1. Write a runbook for "High Error Rate on /api/orders": check recent deployments, inspect logs for new error patterns, check downstream service health, check database connection pool stats.
1. Write a runbook for "Database Connection Pool Exhausted": check `db.Stats()` output, identify long-running queries with `pg_stat_activity`, kill idle-in-transaction connections, increase pool size.

### 66.2 Incident Response

1. Write a Go CLI tool that creates an incident: generates a timestamped incident document from a template, creates a Slack channel name suggestion, and outputs initial status update text.
1. Implement a status page endpoint `GET /status` that returns the current operational status of all service components with severity levels (`operational`, `degraded`, `outage`).
1. Write a postmortem template generator: given incident start/end times, it queries Prometheus for error rates and latency during the window and generates a timeline section.

### 66.3 Alerting

1. Write Prometheus alerting rules for: high error rate (>1% of 5xx in 5 minutes), high latency (p99 > 1s for 5 minutes), and low availability (less than 2 healthy pods).
1. Implement an alert webhook handler in Go: receive PagerDuty/Alertmanager webhooks, parse the payload, and execute automated remediation (e.g., restart a pod, clear a cache).
1. Write an alert fatigue analyzer: query Alertmanager API for alert history, group by alert name, and report alerts that fire more than 10 times per week as candidates for tuning.

## Block 67: Capacity Planning and Performance Budgets

### 67.1 Capacity Estimation

1. Write a capacity calculator in Go: given requests per second, average response time, and target CPU utilization (70%), calculate the number of pods/instances needed.
1. Implement a load model: given a traffic pattern (peak hours, growth rate), project the required infrastructure for 3, 6, and 12 months using exponential growth formula.
1. Write a benchmark suite that determines the maximum RPS a single instance can handle at p99 < 200ms. Use binary search over RPS values with `vegeta` or custom load generation.

### 67.2 Performance Budgets

1. Write a CI check that runs benchmarks and fails if any benchmark regresses by more than 10% compared to the baseline stored in a file.
1. Implement a latency budget tracker: given a total budget of 500ms for an endpoint, track time spent in each layer (handler: 10ms, service: 50ms, database: 200ms, cache: 5ms) and log the breakdown.
1. Write a `LatencyBudget` middleware that sets a deadline on the context based on the remaining budget and passes it to downstream calls.

## Block 68: Zero-Downtime Deployments

### 68.1 Database Migration Strategies for Large Tables

1. Implement an online column addition: add a nullable column, backfill in batches of 1000 rows with `UPDATE ... WHERE id BETWEEN $1 AND $2`, then add a `NOT NULL` constraint.
1. Write a batch backfill function with rate limiting: update N rows per second to avoid overwhelming the database. Use `time.Ticker` to control the pace.
1. Implement a dual-write migration: write to both old and new columns during the transition period. Write a verification query that checks consistency between the two columns.
1. Write a safe column rename migration: add new column, start dual-writing in application code, backfill old rows in batches, switch reads to new column, drop old column. Implement each step as a separate migration.

### 68.2 Feature Toggles

1. Implement feature toggles backed by a database table: `feature_flags(name, enabled, rollout_percentage, created_at)`. Write `IsEnabled(ctx, flag) bool` that checks user hash against rollout percentage.
1. Implement a feature toggle that targets specific users: store a list of user IDs per flag and enable the feature only for those users plus the percentage rollout.
1. Write middleware that injects enabled feature flags into the response headers (`X-Features: new-checkout,dark-mode`) for client-side feature detection.
1. Implement feature flag caching: cache flags in memory for 30 seconds, refresh from database in the background, and serve stale data during refresh failures.

### 68.3 Canary Deployments

1. Write a traffic splitter middleware: route 5% of requests to the canary instance based on a consistent hash of the user ID.
1. Implement canary health monitoring: compare error rates and latencies between canary and stable instances. If the canary error rate is 2x the stable rate, log an alert.
1. Write a gradual rollout controller: increase canary traffic from 5% to 10%, 25%, 50%, 100% with a configurable interval and automatic rollback if error rate exceeds a threshold.

## Block 69: Service Discovery and DNS

### 69.1 DNS-Based Service Discovery

1. Implement DNS-based service discovery: resolve SRV records with `net.LookupSRV("", "", "myservice.service.consul")` and use the returned addresses for load balancing.
1. Write an HTTP client that re-resolves DNS every 30 seconds to pick up new service instances. Store resolved addresses in an `atomic.Value` for lock-free reads.
1. Implement DNS caching with TTL respect: cache resolved addresses for the duration specified in the DNS response, then re-resolve.

### 69.2 Client-Side Load Balancing

1. Implement round-robin load balancing: given a list of backend addresses, distribute requests evenly using an `atomic.Int64` counter.
1. Implement weighted round-robin: assign weights to backends (e.g., based on instance CPU capacity) and distribute requests proportionally.
1. Implement least-connections load balancing: track active request count per backend with `atomic.Int64` and send new requests to the backend with the fewest active connections.
1. Implement health-aware load balancing: periodically health-check backends and remove unhealthy ones from the rotation. Restore them when they recover.

### 69.3 gRPC Load Balancing

1. Implement a custom gRPC `resolver.Builder` that resolves service addresses from a configuration file and notifies the balancer of changes.
1. Use gRPC's built-in `round_robin` balancer with a custom resolver. Write a test with 3 server instances verifying even distribution.
1. Implement a gRPC health-checking resolver: use the gRPC health protocol (`grpc.health.v1.Health`) to remove unhealthy servers from the address list.

## Block 70: Conflict Resolution and CRDTs

### 70.1 Optimistic Concurrency in Distributed Systems

1. Implement a vector clock: each node maintains a counter, increment on local events, merge on receive. Write `Compare(a, b VectorClock) (Before | After | Concurrent)`.
1. Implement last-write-wins (LWW) conflict resolution: given two concurrent updates with timestamps, keep the one with the higher timestamp. Write tests for clock skew scenarios.
1. Implement a version vector for a distributed key-value store: detect conflicting writes and return both versions to the client for application-level resolution.

### 70.2 CRDT Implementations

1. Implement a G-Counter (grow-only counter) CRDT: each node maintains its own counter, the global value is the sum. Write `Increment(nodeID)`, `Value() int`, and `Merge(other GCounter)`.
1. Implement a PN-Counter (positive-negative counter): two G-Counters (one for increments, one for decrements). Support `Increment`, `Decrement`, `Value`, and `Merge`.
1. Implement an OR-Set (observed-remove set) CRDT: support `Add(element)`, `Remove(element)`, `Contains(element) bool`, and `Merge(other ORSet)`. Use unique tags to handle add/remove conflicts.
1. Write a property-based test for each CRDT: verify commutativity (merge order doesn't matter), associativity, and idempotency of the `Merge` operation.

## Block 71: HTTP Server Hardening

### 71.1 Security Headers Middleware

1. Write a middleware that sets security headers on every response: `Content-Security-Policy`, `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `Strict-Transport-Security`, `X-Frame-Options: DENY`, `Referrer-Policy`.
1. Write a middleware that validates the `Content-Type` header on POST/PUT/PATCH requests and rejects requests with unexpected content types with `415 Unsupported Media Type`.
1. Implement CORS middleware from scratch: handle preflight `OPTIONS` requests, validate `Origin` against an allowlist, and set appropriate `Access-Control-*` headers.

### 71.2 Input Validation and Sanitization

1. Write a middleware that limits the request body size using `http.MaxBytesReader`. Return `413 Payload Too Large` with a JSON error body when exceeded.
1. Implement input sanitization for a user profile endpoint: strip HTML tags from string fields using `bluemonday`, normalize Unicode with `golang.org/x/text/unicode/norm`, and trim whitespace.
1. Write a SQL injection demonstration: show a vulnerable query with string concatenation, then fix it with parameterized queries. Write a test that attempts injection and verifies safety.

### 71.3 IP-Based Access Control

1. Implement IP allowlisting middleware: parse a list of CIDR ranges from configuration, check `r.RemoteAddr` (accounting for `X-Forwarded-For` behind a proxy), and reject unauthorized IPs with `403`.
1. Implement IP-based rate limiting: maintain a `map[netip.Addr]*rate.Limiter` with a mutex, create new limiters on first request from an IP, and evict idle limiters after 10 minutes.
1. Write a middleware that extracts the real client IP from `X-Forwarded-For`, `X-Real-IP`, or `r.RemoteAddr` with a configurable trusted proxy list.
